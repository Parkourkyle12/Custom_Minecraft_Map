Custom_Minecraft_Map
================

This is my custom Adventure/Survival map I made for Minecraft. Just download it and place it in your saves in your .minecraft.

If you don't know how to do this:

Go to run or your program search bar and type "%appdata%"
There should be a file called .minecraft. Click that.
Inside will be a folder called "saves". Just drag the file into there.
